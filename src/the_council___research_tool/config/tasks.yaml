process_research_content:
  description: Process the user's research content on {research_topic}. If {research_content}
    is provided by the user, organize and structure this content for analysis. Additionally,
    if research documents are uploaded, use document parsing tools to extract additional
    content. If neither is available, conduct initial web research on {research_topic}.
    Focus on organizing all available information in a structured format for further
    analysis.
  expected_output: A structured research report containing the user's provided content
    on {research_topic}, any extracted document content, and/or web research findings.
    Include organized sections for key points, methodologies, findings, and any research
    questions or hypotheses presented. Present all information in a clear, structured
    format ready for analysis by subsequent agents.
  agent: research_content_processor
summarize_research_content:
  description: 'Create detailed summaries of all parsed research content on {research_topic}.
    For each document, generate a structured summary that includes: key findings,
    research methodology, main conclusions, limitations, and significance. Then create
    an overarching summary that highlights common themes, recurring findings, and
    the collective insights from all uploaded materials.'
  expected_output: Individual summaries for each document and a comprehensive overview
    summary in markdown format. Each summary should include key findings, methodology,
    conclusions, and relevance to {research_topic}. The overview should highlight
    common patterns, themes, and collective insights across all materials.

conduct_external_research:
  description: Perform comprehensive external research on {research_topic} to complement
    the uploaded materials. Search for recent academic papers, industry reports, and
    authoritative sources to identify current trends, new developments, alternative
    perspectives, and additional research that provides context to the uploaded documents.
    Focus on finding both supporting and contrasting evidence.
  expected_output: A detailed research report in markdown format containing recent
    findings, current state of research in {research_topic}, key external sources
    that complement the uploaded materials, and identification of external research
    that either supports or challenges the findings in the uploaded documents.

critique_research_quality:
  description: Provide rigorous critical analysis of all research materials on {research_topic},
    both uploaded and externally sourced. Evaluate methodological rigor, statistical
    validity, potential biases, sample sizes, research design appropriateness, and
    logical consistency of conclusions. Identify strengths and weaknesses in each
    study and assess the overall quality of evidence presented.
  expected_output: A comprehensive critical analysis report in markdown format detailing
    the methodological strengths and weaknesses of each piece of research, assessment
    of evidence quality, identification of potential biases, and overall evaluation
    of the research landscape quality for {research_topic}.

identify_research_gaps:
  description: Analyze all research materials on {research_topic} to identify knowledge
    gaps, unexplored areas, methodological limitations, and research opportunities.
    Compare what has been studied versus what needs investigation, identify contradictory
    findings that require resolution, and suggest priority areas for future research
    that would advance understanding of {research_topic}.
  expected_output: A detailed gap analysis report in markdown format identifying specific
    knowledge gaps, unexplored research areas, methodological improvements needed,
    contradictions requiring resolution, and prioritized recommendations for future
    research directions in {research_topic}.

synthesize_research_findings:
  description: Create a comprehensive synthesis of all research analysis on {research_topic}
    by integrating insights from document summaries, external research, critical analysis,
    and gap identification. Develop a cohesive narrative that presents the current
    state of knowledge, reconciles conflicting findings, highlights areas of consensus,
    and provides clear conclusions about what is known and unknown in {research_topic}.
  expected_output: A comprehensive research synthesis report in markdown format that
    serves as the definitive analysis of {research_topic} based on all available materials.
    The report should include executive summary, current state of knowledge, key findings
    and consensus, areas of debate or uncertainty, critical limitations, identified
    gaps, and strategic recommendations for the field.
